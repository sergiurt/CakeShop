# Assignment 6

For your chosen problem implement the requirements below:
-	Make sure that the _delete_ operation maintains data consistency and that all related entities are deleted automatically, when needed. See examples for each problem below:
    * when a patient is deleted, his/her appointments are also deleted
    * when a cake is deleted, it will also be deleted from the orders that contain it
    * when a car is deleted, its  rentals will also be deleted
-	Design a JavaFX GUI which allows CRUD operations for just one entity. Build this UI programmatically in Java (no declarative UI definition - no FXML). The classes in layers except the UI should not be modified.
